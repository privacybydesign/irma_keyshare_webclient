IRMA keyshare webclient
======================

This project contains the web interface to interact with the [irmago MyIRMA backend server](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/tree/master/server/keyshare/myirmaserver). In particular it allows users to

 * edit the email addresses that are linked to the account;
 * inspect a log of recent actions; and
 * disable the user's IRMA app.

Instructions on how to run the MyIRMA backend server can be found in the [irmago README](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmago#running).
